Maker Faire Orlando is a curated event. We reserve the right to select exhibits based on proposal completeness, exhibit content, content diversity, items sold, and other factors.

Exhibits are not approved in the order received, and are reviewed and approved in batches. We will contact you via the email provided in the exhibit application if we need more information or when your application has been approved or rejected. We are an all-volunteer team and we appreciate your patience as we process hundreds of applications.

Unfortunately, we do not have space at the event for all exhibit applications. Please ensure that you highlight your exhibit with good photos / video / description when you submit. We also maintain a balance between selling / non-selling exhibits and a good mix of the type of exhibits.
