  description: "I am a 14-year-old fiber artist focusing on weaving, spinning, and garment design.  All of the products in my shop contain a piece of my handwoven fabric made with all-natural fibers.  I can take fiber off a sheep and transform it into something both beautiful and functional.  

There are two very interesting things about my exhibition set-up that I think would be a great fit for Maker Faire.  
1.  I weave in my booth.  The action of a floor loom is mesmerizing and people stand and watch for long periods of time trying to figure out how the patterns are made.  
2.  My booth itself is on wheels and my brother and I built it.  Talk about Maker Faire heaven!  We bought a $400 utility trailer base at Harbor Freight and built the shop you see here - https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr7PtwSoXuP/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==

I am homeschooled, but attend a fashion school/college virtually in Vancouver.
