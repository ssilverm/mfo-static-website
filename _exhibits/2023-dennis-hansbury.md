ABOUT THE ARTIST:
Dennis first began creating dark and adorable crocheted animals and undead zombie plushies from his little Arizona apartment in 2005, finding loving homes for them across the world through his first shop on Etsy. As time passed and he moved to Florida, new passions were ignited - gallery shows and fine art became the focus, but he never stopped incorporating his gloomy, gothic, and gory aesthetic into his work. The passion for creating one-of-a-kind, handmade items would inspire him further, and woodworking soon became a permanent staple in his artwork.

Fueled by his lifelong adoration for Halloween, and brimming with quirky poems that provide a deeper dimension to his work, Dennis continues to bring life to the vast array of untold stories and subtle whispers he carries with him each day."
