description-long: "I have always enjoyed creating Rube Goldberg style machines.  Most of my ideas come to me gradually, piece by piece with inspiration drawn from a variety of sources.  When I am trying to create something awesome, I believe that it should look good, sound good, and taste good. I also believe that whatever I dream up, must get kids and adults interested by incorporating Science, Engineering, and Math in a way that is practical and engaging.  Sometimes I have a desired outcome and work backwards by designing a machine that will make that product.  Other times, I decide to start building something without yet knowing what the final product will be.  This is the process that led to the Human Powered Frozen Beverage Machine"
